# Data Structure and Algorithm Assignment
This program manages academic publications and their affiliations. It supports operations such as:

Adding publications, affiliations, and references
Querying relationships between them
Finding the shortest paths between affiliations
The system efficiently maintains and updates data structures to enable fast retrieval and graph-based queries, optimizing the use of CPU resources.

# My contribution
* Implemented key data structures in datastructures.hh and datastructures.cc for efficient management of academic data.
* Focused on minimizing CPU usage while ensuring fast query performance. (Note: Memory consumption was not a focus in this assignment, resulting in some auxiliary data structures.)

## Tools Used
Developed with QT Creator 9.
